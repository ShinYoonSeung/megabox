"Cut the neck of the green knight to protect his honor".
On Christmas Eve, a green article appeared in front of King Arthur and the knights of Roundtable, suggesting, "The bravest, if you hit my neck, I will give you honor and wealth."

King Arthur's nephew Gawain accepted the challenge and finally a year later, he began his journey through five gates of hardshipâ€¦
A new adventure to become a legend, put your honor on your neck!
